# The value of your django project's STATIC_ROOT settings.
# This will be the directory that django's `collectstatic` management command
# copies static files to, and it must be an absolute path. The default value 
# here assumes that STATIC_ROOT is set in your settings.py like so:
# STATIC_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'))
static_root: "{{ django_project_path }}/static"

# the dns name or names (space separated) for your server
server_name: leads_tracking.local

# database setup. Note that because this playbook doesn't touch the default 
# postgres pg_hba.conf file, we use local password-based authentication for
# postgres and thus you need to provide a username and password, and your
# settings.py MUST set "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" as the HOST value. For
# example, the default settings here assume the following values in
# settings.py:
# DATABASES = {
#     'default': {
#         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
#         'HOST': 'localhost',
#         'NAME': 'hello',
#         'USER': 'hello',
#         'PASSWORD': 'changeme',
#     }
